# Juice Shop Setup

We are going to run OWASP Juice Shop locally, but you are welcome to explore the [Docker Container directions](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop#docker-container) as well. 
    - <span style = "color: #FE4646">**NOTE**</span>: If you use Docker, some challenges will be inaccessible.
