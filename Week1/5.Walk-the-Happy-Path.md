# Walk the Happy Path

When investigating an application for security vulnerabilities, you should never blindly start throwing attack payloads at it. Instead, **make sure you understand how it works before attempting any exploits.** A good way to gain an understanding for the application, is to actually use it in the way it was meant to be used by a normal user. In regular software testing this is often called "happy path" testing.
