## Tips for Finding the Score Board

Why was the Score Board not visited during the "happy path" tour? Because there seemed to be no link anywhere in the application that would lead you there! You know that it must exist, which leaves a few possible explanations:
1. You missed the link during the initial mapping of the application (not likely).
2. There is a URL that leads to the Score Board but it is not hyperlinked to.
3. Knowing it exists, you can simply guess what URL the Score Board might have.
4. Alternatively, you can try to find a reference or clue within the parts of the application that are not usually visible in the browser, <span style = "color: #FE4646">**but are visible using the Developer Tools.**</span>
