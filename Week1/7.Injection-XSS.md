# Injection with Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Modern websites are constantly accepting data. Think about something as simple as a search bar on the [Google homepage](https://www.google.com/). We type ***data*** into this search bar and the browser returns information to us.

Search bars and other areas for user input are inherently insecure because there is nothing stopping the user from entering a command that could run malicious code on our otherwise safe web browser. ‚≠êÔ∏è <span style = "color: #21B581">**Without proper security protections, areas for user input can be utilized to send a browser side script that can be triggered by unsuspecting users.**</span>

<span style = "color: #FE4646">**Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**</span> is a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

## XSS Injection

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks typically are broken down into three distinct phases:
1. The hacker injects a trusted website with a malicious script (something like `<iframe src="javascript:alert("xss")/>`).
2. The victim visits an otherwise trusted website and triggers the malicious script that has been injected.
3. The victims browser runs the malicious script and unknowingly forwards desired information (session tokens, cookies, etc.) to the hacker that injected the script.

2. What is one potential consequence of an XSS attack?
    - **The victim‚Äôs browser executes a malicious script that forwards sensitive data to the hacker.**
    - A user can no longer visit a website
    - The server is overloaded with requests
    - The database runs a command injected by a hacker
