# Broken Access Control
Imagine you're at the doctor's office, and you finished your appointment. You're just waiting for the nurse to bring you a printed summary of your diagnosis and treatment. The nurse comes in, and hands you the paperwork, you look at it and it's actually not yours.  It's someone else's! The nurse made a mistake, and now you have access to someone else's medical data.

This is the concept behind the number one OWASP Web Application Security Risks: <span style = "color: #FE4646">**Broken Access Control**</span> or when people have access to information they shouldn‚Äôt have access to. ‚≠êÔ∏è <span style = "color: #21B581">**Access control design decisions (e.g. which users have access to administrator privileges) have to be made by humans, not technology, and thus the potential for errors is high.**</span>

## Try It Out! üíª

Below is an example of an application that currently does not have any access control. Any user can access the user information. Let's implement some basic access controls.

1. Create a variable called `isAuthorized`. This should check that the user id matches the the id in the URL parameters.
    <details>

    ```javascript
    const isAuthorized = user.id == req.params.id;
    ```

    </details>

2. If the user is not authorized, use `sendStatus()` to send a status of 401 (the client does not have authorization). If they are authorized, send a response with the user information.
    <details>

    ```javascript
    if(!isAuthorized){
        res.sendStatus(401);
    }
    res.send(user);
    ```

    </details>

> **NOTE**: This is an inherently basic example to introduce access controls. If an individual knew the route, they could access any user in the database. However, if you have them login before granting access, this would separate concerns and introduce stronger access controls

## Knowledge Checks ‚úÖ

1. **Fill In The Blank**: According to OWASP, Broken Access Control occurs when confidential information is viewed by a user who should [blank] have permission to access that data

2. When it comes to Broken Access Control, what is the main thing we need to remember?
    - We should encrypt data when it is in transit or at rest
    - Passwords need to be hashed before saving to the database
    - **We should make sure that the right person is receiving the right data.**
