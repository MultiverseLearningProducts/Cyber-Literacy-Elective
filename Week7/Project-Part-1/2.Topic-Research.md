- [Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
- [Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)
- [Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/)
- [Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/)

**Be sure to explore the additional links as each topic has sub pages that will aid in your presentation construction!** Additionally, there is a wealth of knowledge that can be found on these topics on the Internet. Do a cursory Google search to gain additional insights as many web service and cybersecurity  providers have additional documentation and visuals that you may find useful. ‚≠êÔ∏è <span style = "color: #21B581">**OWASP should be your starting point for your research, but not your ending point!**</span>
