# Presentation Recording üé•

Since we‚Äôll be presenting the recordings to each other, we‚Äôll need to record the presentations as we have done in the past. The video below provides some [tips and tricks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J9YPfiAVux4rKc7H5gT3inTD1gjSpnOLLT19DWeZxAo/edit#slide=id.g177146c0392_0_0) as you record your presentations.

## Steps to Record Your Videos

1. With your team, explore video recording software and choose one to use. We recommend:
    - Loom (cool)
    - Zoom (easiest and works great!)
    - Quicktime (screen & face in one video is hard)
2. Create a script for your video using the slides that you created in the previous section
    - Follow the order of your presentation, and plan how you will make transitions between speakers.
3. Practice!
    - Do at least one ‚Äúrun through‚Äù of the presentation before you start recording. You don‚Äôt have to have everyone say every single line that they will do, but practice the introduction, transitions, and closing of the video
4. Record, Edit, & Upload to YouTube
    - Once you have recorded a version of the presentation that your team is happy with, upload it to YouTube.
5. Share the final link to your video below
6. **TASK**: Please enter the URL to your uploaded video presentation. Also send the link to the YouTube video to your coach!
