# Project Selection

You have built **A LOT** during your time in this program, but we haven't always considered the security implications of the programs that we are building. ⭐️ <span style = "color: #21B581">**You will pick ONE old project and create a more secure version of the application based on what you have learned these past six weeks.**</span>

## Past Projects to Consider

> You can pick a project that is either deployed or lives locally on your machine, but a deployed project is preferable as some security concerns may be harder to catch prior to deployment.

While you can choose to add security enhancements to any project in your portfolio, it is recommended that you pick one of the following projects:

1. **Inventory App Project**
    - This project lacks authorization. You could consider how to incorporate authorization and enhance the user interface to protect against certain attacks.
2. **Hackathon Project**
    - You did this project in the 2nd language that you taught yourself. It is likely that many of the components you used failed to consider security concerns. 
3. **Back End Module Project**
    - You constructed your own API and likely incorporated some authorization into it. Consider how you could enhance this API with additional security given what you have learned during this elective.
4. **Deployment Module Project**
    - This was a full stack application that incorporated both front end and back end. This project likely has numerous vulnerabilities that you did not consider when building this application the first time!

The security enhancements that you opt to utilize here is totally up to you, but ⭐️ <span style = "color: #21B581">**whichever security enhancements that you decide to incorporate should be rooted in the OWASP Top 10.**</span>
