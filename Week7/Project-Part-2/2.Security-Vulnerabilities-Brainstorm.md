## Identifying Security Vulnerabilities

**GOAL**: Identify security vulnerabilities in the project that you selected.

1. Open the application that you selected in the last section and walk the happy path much like you did when you started the OWASP Juice Shop.
2. As you walk the happy path, consider what you have learned about the OWASP Top 10 and how they may be used to attack your site. Some ideas to consider:
    - Adding OAuth or other authentication features
    - Checking user input for malicious content like SQL injection and/or XSS
    - Implementing passwords with correct level of security
    - Fixing routes for proper access controls
    - Implementing multifactor authentication
    - Removing any security by obscurity that exists in your application.
    - Researching other security tools and incorporating them in your application
3. Capture at least 5 security vulnerabilities that you should address in your project.
4. List out at least 5 security vulnerabilities that you found in your project.
