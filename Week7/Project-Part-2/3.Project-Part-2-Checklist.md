## Project Code Summary

1. Use the area below to summarize the security features that you added to your application. ⭐️ <span style = "color: #21B581">**A complete application should incorporate as many additional security features as time allows.**</span> There is no upper limit to how much security you add to your application, but a few starting points could be:
    - Adding OAuth or other authentication features
    - Checking user input for malicious content like SQL injection and/or XSS
    - Implementing passwords with correct level of security
    - Fixing routes for proper access controls
    - Implementing multifactor authentication
    - Removing any security by obscurity that exists in your application.
